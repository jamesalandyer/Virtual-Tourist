# Virtual-Tourist #
An iOS app that allows you to see a photo album of photos near any location you choose.

This is a Core Data app that allows you to drop a pin down anywhere on the map. It then allows you to view a photo album of photos near that pin. You can also refresh the photo album to see more photos. You can also click on the photo to make it larger. You can delete photos from the photo album. Whenever you make changes it persists the changes to Core Data so that when you exit the app everything is saved for when you open it again.

# Running The Project #
You can download the project and run the Virtual Tourist.xcodeproj file in the iOS simulator.
